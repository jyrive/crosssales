## Understanding Cross-Sales vs Next Best Actions

### What is Cross-Sales?
**Cross-sales** is the practice of selling additional insurance products to existing customers who already have one or more policies with your company. The goal is to expand the customer's insurance portfolio by identifying gaps in their coverage.

#### Cross-Sales Examples in Insurance:

**Example 1: Manufacturing Company**
- **Current Policy**: General Liability Insurance (€2,400/year)
- **Cross-Sales Opportunities**: 
  - Product Liability Insurance (€1,800/year) - to cover defects in manufactured goods
  - Cyber Security Insurance (€1,200/year) - to protect digital operations
  - Workers' Compensation (€3,600/year) - to cover workplace injuries

**Example 2: IT Services Company**
- **Current Policy**: Professional Indemnity Insurance (€3,000/year)
- **Cross-Sales Opportunities**:
  - Cyber Liability Insurance (€2,500/year) - essential for data protection
  - Directors & Officers Insurance (€1,500/year) - for management protection
  - Business Interruption Insurance (€2,000/year) - for operational continuity

### What are Next Best Actions?
**Next Best Actions** are specific, timely recommendations for customer engagement that go beyond just selling products. They include the optimal interaction, timing, and communication strategy to maximize customer value and satisfaction.

#### Next Best Action Examples in Insurance:

**Example 1: Policy Renewal Approaching**
- **Situation**: Customer's General Liability policy expires in 60 days
- **Next Best Action**: 
  - **Action**: Send renewal reminder with coverage review offer
  - **Timing**: 45 days before expiration
  - **Channel**: Email + customer portal notification
  - **Value Add**: Free risk assessment to identify new exposures

**Example 2: Business Growth Signal Detected**
- **Situation**: Customer reports 40% revenue increase in annual filing
- **Next Best Action**:
  - **Action**: Schedule consultation to review coverage adequacy
  - **Timing**: Within 2 weeks of revenue update
  - **Channel**: Personal call from account manager
  - **Value Add**: Coverage gap analysis and premium adjustment options

**Example 3: Industry Risk Event**
- **Situation**: Major cyber attack reported in customer's industry sector
- **Next Best Action**:
  - **Action**: Proactive outreach with cyber security assessment
  - **Timing**: Within 48 hours of news event
  - **Channel**: Targeted email campaign
  - **Value Add**: Free cyber risk evaluation and preventive measures guide

### Key Differences Summary

| Aspect | Cross-Sales | Next Best Actions |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Product expansion | Optimal engagement strategy |
| **Goal** | Sell additional insurance products | Maximize customer interaction value |
| **Timing** | Ongoing opportunity identification | Event-triggered or time-based |
| **Approach** | "What else can we sell?" | "What should we do next?" |
| **Example** | Recommend cyber insurance to IT company | Call customer after industry cyber attack |

### How They Work Together
Cross-sales and next best actions are complementary:
- **Next Best Actions** determine the *how* and *when* to engage customers
- **Cross-Sales** determine the *what* to offer customers
- Together they create a comprehensive customer engagement strategy

**Combined Example:**
1. **Trigger Event**: Customer hires 20 new employees (detected from payroll data)
2. **Next Best Action**: Schedule call within 1 week to discuss workforce changes
3. **Cross-Sales Opportunity**: During the call, recommend Workers' Compensation increase and Group Life Insurance

## Cross-Sales During Purchase Process (Webshop Integration)

### Real-Time Cross-Sales Opportunities

**Yes, cross-sales is highly effective during the webshop buying process!** This represents one of the best conversion opportunities because customers are already in a purchasing mindset and engaged with your insurance offerings.

#### Why Webshop Cross-Sales is Powerful

- **Lower Resistance**: Purchasing mindset reduces hesitation to add products
- **Immediate Context**: Can leverage the specific product being purchased
- **Convenience**: Easy to add products to existing transaction
- **Cost Efficiency**: Bundle products for better pricing

### Webshop Cross-Sales Implementation Strategy

#### Smart Recommendation Logic
1. **Industry-Based Suggestions**: IT company buying General Liability → Suggest Cyber + Professional Indemnity
2. **Company Size Triggers**: 15+ employees → Recommend Group Life + Workers' Compensation
3. **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Missing critical industry-standard coverage → Highlight gaps
4. **Bundling Opportunities**: Multiple products → Show discount bundles
5. **Peer Benchmarking**: "89% of similar companies also have..."

#### Timing Optimization
- **Quote Building**: Progressive disclosure during quote process
- **Cart Review**: Final opportunity before purchase decision
- **Post-Purchase**: Immediate follow-up while engagement is high
- **Welcome Series**: 7-day email sequence with special offers

#### Conversion Tactics
- **Bundle Discounts**: Financial incentives for multiple products
- **Social Proof**: Industry statistics and peer comparisons
- **Urgency**: Limited-time offers and expiring discounts
- **Risk Highlighting**: Coverage gap warnings and industry examples
- **One-Click Adding**: Minimal friction to add products

### Integration with Logical Components

#### How Webshop Cross-Sales Fits the Architecture:

**Cross-Sales Engine** → Analyzes customer profile during quote process
**Decision Orchestrator** → Determines which products to show when
**Delivery Engine** → **Digital Web Shops** display recommendations in real-time
**Feedback & Learning** → Tracks conversion rates to optimize recommendations

#### Data Flow During Purchase:
```
Customer enters webshop → 
Profile loaded from MyBusiness/CRM →
Cross-Sales Engine analyzes in real-time →
Decision Orchestrator prioritizes recommendations →
Webshop displays targeted suggestions →
Customer adds products to cart →
System tracks conversions for learning
```

### Success Metrics for Webshop Cross-Sales

- **Attachment Rate**: % of customers who add cross-sell products
- **Average Order Value**: Increase in total premium per transaction
- **Conversion by Product**: Which cross-sells perform best
- **Bundle Take Rate**: % choosing bundles vs. individual products
- **Time to Purchase**: Impact on checkout completion rates

**Expected Results**: Industry benchmarks show 15-30% attachment rates for well-implemented webshop cross-sales in insurance, with 25-40% increase in average order value.

This webshop integration makes cross-sales a natural part of the purchase journey rather than a separate sales activity, significantly improving conversion rates and customer lifetime value.

## Logical System Components Architecture

### System Overview
The cross-sales solution consists of six core logical components that work together to deliver intelligent recommendations and optimal customer engagement. Each component has specific responsibilities for either cross-sales product identification or next best action determination.

### Component Specifications

#### 1. Data Aggregation Layer
**Purpose**: Centralized data collection and normalization for all system components

**What It Practically Does**:
The Data Aggregation Layer operates as the system's "data brain" that continuously collects, cleans, and prepares information from multiple sources. Think of it as a 24/7 data factory that:

- **Monitors Multiple Data Sources**: Automatically polls Salesforce CRM, policy administration systems, payment systems, MyBusiness portal, and external data providers every 15-30 minutes
- **Real-Time Event Processing**: Captures instant events like policy purchases, claim submissions, portal logins, quote requests, and business filing updates
- **Data Quality Management**: Identifies missing information, validates data formats, flags inconsistencies (e.g., conflicting employee counts), and enriches incomplete records
- **Customer Profile Building**: Maintains a single, constantly updated view of each customer combining policy data, business information, interaction history, and behavioral patterns
- **Event Stream Creation**: Generates real-time notifications when significant events occur (policy changes, business growth, industry incidents) that trigger downstream actions

**Daily Operations Example**:
- 6:00 AM: Batch import of overnight policy changes from administration system
- Throughout day: Real-time capture of MyBusiness portal activity (logins, document downloads, quote requests)
- Every hour: Check external data providers for business information updates (credit reports, industry news)
- When customer updates employee count in MyBusiness: Immediately create event stream to trigger coverage adequacy review

**Inputs**:
- Customer master data (company profile, contact details, business registration)
- Policy portfolio data (active policies, coverage limits, premium amounts, renewal dates)
- Claims history (past claims, amounts, frequency, resolution status)
- Business events (revenue changes, employee count updates, location changes, industry shifts)
- External market data (industry risk reports, regulatory changes, competitive intelligence)
- Customer behavior data (portal usage, email engagement, quote requests, support contacts)

**Outputs**:
- Unified customer profiles with standardized data formats
- Real-time data feeds to downstream components
- Data quality scores and completeness indicators
- Event streams for trigger-based processing

**Existing Systems Integration**:
- **Azure Data Factory**: ETL pipelines for data integration and transformation
- **Databricks**: Data lakehouse for large-scale data processing and analytics
- **Salesforce**: CRM data via APIs and connectors
- **Alternative Solutions**: AWS Glue, Google Cloud Dataflow, Snowflake, Informatica

**Used For**: Both cross-sales and next best actions (foundational data layer)

---

#### 2. Customer Intelligence Engine
**Purpose**: Transform raw customer data into actionable business insights and segments

**What It Practically Does**:
The Customer Intelligence Engine acts as the system's "business analyst" that continuously evaluates customer data to create intelligent profiles and predictions. It:

- **Customer Risk Assessment**: Analyzes industry type, company size, claims history, and financial data to calculate risk scores (1-100). For example, a 25-employee IT company with no claims gets a medium risk score of 65, while a 5-employee consulting firm gets 45 (lower risk)
- **Behavioral Pattern Recognition**: Tracks customer engagement patterns - identifies highly engaged customers (frequent portal logins, downloads policy docs) vs. passive customers (only login for renewals)
- **Business Lifecycle Identification**: Determines if company is in startup phase (irregular revenue), growth phase (increasing employees), or mature phase (stable patterns) based on data trends
- **Peer Group Analysis**: Compares each customer against similar companies in same industry/size to identify coverage gaps and opportunities
- **Propensity Scoring**: Calculates likelihood scores for various actions: 85% likely to renew, 32% likely to buy cyber insurance, 15% churn risk

**Daily Operations Example**:
- Morning: Process overnight data updates and recalculate risk profiles for 500 customers whose data changed
- Continuous: Monitor behavioral signals - flag customer who suddenly increased portal activity (possible expansion signal)
- Weekly: Update industry benchmarks and peer comparisons based on new market data
- Monthly: Recalibrate propensity models based on recent conversion data

**Inputs**:
- Unified customer profiles from Data Aggregation Layer
- Industry benchmarking data (peer company analysis, market standards)
- Risk assessment models (industry risk factors, company size correlations)
- Regulatory requirements (mandatory coverage by industry/country)

**Outputs**:
- Customer risk profiles (low, medium, high risk categorization)
- Business segment classifications (micro, small, medium enterprise)
- Coverage gap analysis (unprotected vs. protected risk areas)
- Customer lifecycle stage identification (startup, growth, mature, declining)
- Propensity scores (likelihood to purchase, churn risk, engagement level)

**Existing Systems Integration**:
- **Salesforce Einstein Analytics**: Customer segmentation and predictive analytics
- **Azure Machine Learning**: Custom ML models for risk profiling and propensity scoring
- **Databricks**: Advanced analytics and machine learning model development
- **Alternative Solutions**: SAS Customer Intelligence, IBM Watson Customer Engagement, Google Cloud AI Platform

**Used For**: Both cross-sales and next best actions (creates foundation for targeting)

---

#### 3a. Cross-Sales Engine (Product Focus)
**Purpose**: Identify which insurance products to recommend based on customer profile and gaps

**What It Practically Does**:
The Cross-Sales Engine operates as the system's "insurance consultant" that continuously evaluates each customer's insurance portfolio and identifies specific product opportunities. It:

- **Coverage Gap Detection**: Systematically compares customer's current policies against industry standards and regulatory requirements. For example, identifies that 85% of similar IT companies have cyber insurance but this customer doesn't
- **Product Matching Logic**: Uses complex rule sets to match customer characteristics to product suitability (IT company + 15+ employees + handles client data = High Priority for Cyber Liability + Professional Indemnity)
- **Premium Calculation**: Integrates with underwriting systems to generate real-time premium estimates based on customer's actual business profile
- **Bundle Optimization**: Identifies complementary products that can be bundled together for cost savings (General Liability + Professional Indemnity + Cyber = Business Protection Bundle with 15% discount)
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Compares recommended products against market alternatives to ensure competitive positioning

**Daily Operations Example**:
- Real-time analysis: When customer views General Liability in webshop, immediately analyze profile and suggest relevant add-ons
- Batch processing: Nightly analysis of all customers to identify new cross-sell opportunities based on portfolio changes
- Trigger-based recommendations: When customer reports revenue growth, automatically reassess coverage limits and suggest upgrades
- Market response: When new cyber threat emerges, identify all customers without cyber coverage for proactive outreach

**Inputs**:
- Customer risk profiles and segment classifications
- Current policy portfolio analysis
- Coverage gap assessments
- Industry-specific insurance requirements
- Product catalog with eligibility criteria

**Outputs**:
- Ranked list of insurance products with relevance scores (1-100)
- Premium estimates for each recommended product
- Coverage benefit explanations (what risks are addressed)
- Product bundling opportunities (discounts for multiple products)
- Competitive positioning (how our products compare to market)

**Existing Systems Integration**:
- **Salesforce Pardot**: Lead scoring and product recommendation campaigns
- **Azure Cognitive Services**: Recommendation APIs for personalized product suggestions
- **Custom Development**: Product catalog integration with your existing policy systems
- **Alternative Solutions**: Adobe Target, Amazon Personalize, Google Recommendations AI, Optimizely

**Used For**: Cross-sales specifically (answers "WHAT to sell")

**Examples**:
- IT company → Recommend Cyber Liability Insurance
- Manufacturing company → Suggest Product Liability coverage
- Growing company → Propose increased coverage limits

---

#### 3b. Next Best Action Engine (Engagement Focus)
**Purpose**: Determine optimal timing, channel, and approach for customer interactions

**What It Practically Does**:
The Next Best Action Engine functions as the system's "engagement strategist" that determines not what to sell, but how and when to approach each customer for maximum effectiveness. It:

- **Timing Optimization**: Analyzes customer behavior patterns to identify optimal contact windows. For example, learns that Customer A responds best to emails on Tuesday mornings, while Customer B prefers phone calls on Thursday afternoons
- **Channel Selection**: Determines the most effective communication method for each customer based on historical response rates (email open rates, phone answer rates, portal engagement)
- **Message Personalization**: Creates context-aware communication strategies based on current customer situation (policy renewal due, recent business growth, industry risk event)
- **Sequence Orchestration**: Designs multi-touch campaigns with appropriate timing intervals (initial email, follow-up call in 3 days, final reminder email in 1 week)
- **Urgency Assessment**: Prioritizes actions based on time sensitivity (policy expiring in 7 days = highest priority, general cross-sell = lower priority)

**Daily Operations Example**:
- Morning prioritization: Generate daily action list for customer service team ranked by urgency and likelihood of success
- Real-time triggers: When industry cyber attack news breaks, immediately queue proactive outreach to all customers without cyber coverage
- Behavioral response: Customer logs into MyBusiness 3 times this week → trigger in-app recommendation popup on next login
- Renewal management: Automatically schedule renewal reminder emails 60, 30, and 7 days before policy expiration based on customer's historical response timing

**Inputs**:
- Customer engagement history (past communication preferences, response rates)
- Policy renewal calendars and important dates
- Business event triggers (growth signals, industry incidents, regulatory changes)
- Customer behavioral patterns (login frequency, document download activity)
- Channel preference data (email, phone, portal, mobile app usage)

**Outputs**:
- Prioritized action recommendations with urgency levels
- Optimal timing suggestions (best day/time for outreach)
- Channel recommendations (email, phone, SMS, in-app notification)
- Personalized message templates and content suggestions
- Follow-up sequence recommendations (if initial contact unsuccessful)

**Existing Systems Integration**:
- **Salesforce Marketing Cloud**: Journey Builder for automated next best action workflows
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Event-driven workflow automation and trigger management
- **Salesforce Service Cloud**: Case management and customer interaction tracking
- **Alternative Solutions**: HubSpot Marketing Automation, Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Mailchimp

**Used For**: Next best actions specifically (answers "HOW and WHEN to engage")

**Examples**:
- Policy expires in 30 days → Send renewal reminder via email
- Industry cyber attack news → Immediate proactive call within 48 hours

---

#### 4. Decision Orchestrator
**Purpose**: Coordinate and prioritize recommendations from both engines to avoid overwhelming customers

**What It Practically Does**:
The Decision Orchestrator acts as the system's "campaign manager" that ensures customers receive the right message at the right time without being overwhelmed. It:

- **Recommendation Prioritization**: Balances product opportunities (Cross-Sales Engine) with optimal timing (Next Best Action Engine) to create a single prioritized action plan. For example, even if customer needs 5 products, only presents top 2 to avoid overwhelm
- **Communication Conflict Resolution**: Prevents multiple simultaneous outreach attempts (no renewal email and cross-sell call on same day)
- **Business Rules Enforcement**: Applies company policies like "maximum 3 product recommendations per month" and "no sales contact within 30 days of claim"
- **Resource Allocation**: Decides which opportunities get personal attention (high-value prospects get sales rep calls) vs. automated treatment (standard renewals get email campaigns)
- **Campaign Coordination**: Ensures consistent messaging across all touchpoints - if customer gets renewal email, the MyBusiness portal shows aligned messaging

**Daily Operations Example**:
- Morning coordination: Reviews overnight recommendations from both engines, resolves conflicts, creates unified daily action plan
- Real-time decisions: Customer calls about claim → temporarily suppresses all cross-sell activities for this customer
- Campaign management: Customer scheduled for cyber insurance email tomorrow → delays general cross-sell popup in MyBusiness portal
- Capacity management: Sales team at capacity → routes lower-priority opportunities to automated email campaigns instead of personal calls

**Inputs**:
- Cross-sales product recommendations with scores
- Next best action suggestions with timing
- Customer communication limits and preferences
- Business rules and constraints (max recommendations per period, product conflicts)
- Current campaign performance metrics

**Outputs**:
- Final prioritized recommendation list (max 3 products per customer per month)
- Execution timeline with specific dates and times
- Channel allocation decisions (which message goes through which channel)
- Conflict resolution (ensuring consistent messaging across touchpoints)
- Resource allocation recommendations (sales rep assignment, automated vs. personal touch)

**Existing Systems Integration**:
- **Salesforce**: Service Cloud Einstein for recommendation orchestration and workflow automation
- **Alternative Solutions**: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, Adobe Experience Platform Decision Engine

**Used For**: Both cross-sales and next best actions (ensures coordinated customer experience)

**Used For**: Both cross-sales and next best actions (ensures coordinated customer experience)

#### 5. Delivery Engine
**Purpose**: Execute the recommended actions through appropriate channels and track results

**What It Practically Does**:
The Delivery Engine serves as the system's "execution team" that takes the orchestrated plan and actually delivers it to customers through various channels. It:

- **Multi-Channel Execution**: Simultaneously manages email campaigns, SMS notifications, MyBusiness portal updates, mobile app push notifications, and sales team task assignments
- **Message Personalization**: Takes generic templates and fills them with customer-specific data (company name, policy details, specific recommendations, personal account manager name)
- **Delivery Scheduling**: Executes communications at precisely the right time based on customer time zones, business hours, and optimal engagement windows
- **Real-Time Portal Updates**: Instantly updates MyBusiness dashboard with new recommendations, alerts, and notifications when customers log in
- **Sales Team Coordination**: Creates tasks in Salesforce for account managers, provides scripts and background information for calls, tracks completion status
- **Response Tracking**: Monitors email opens, clicks, phone call outcomes, portal engagement, and quote requests to measure immediate effectiveness

**Daily Operations Example**:
- 8:00 AM: Send 150 personalized renewal reminder emails to customers with policies expiring in 30 days
- Throughout day: Update MyBusiness portals in real-time as customers log in, showing personalized cross-sell recommendations
- 2:00 PM: Send push notification to mobile app users about limited-time cyber insurance discount
- Continuous: Create and assign sales tasks in Salesforce based on high-priority opportunities identified by Decision Orchestrator
- Evening: Generate delivery reports showing email open rates, portal engagement, and initial customer responses

**Inputs**:
- Finalized action plan from Decision Orchestrator
- Customer contact details and preferences
- Message templates and personalization data
- Channel-specific formatting requirements (email HTML, SMS character limits)
- Scheduling constraints (business hours, time zones, blackout periods)

**Outputs**:
- Delivered communications across all channels (email, SMS, push notifications, calls)
- Customer portal updates (dashboard recommendations, alerts)
- Sales team assignments and tasks
- Delivery confirmation and receipt tracking
- Initial response metrics (open rates, click rates, conversion signals)

**Existing Systems Integration**:
- **MyBusiness Portal**: Customer self-service interface for displaying recommendations and alerts
- **Digital Web Shops**: Direct integration for seamless product purchase flow
- **Salesforce Marketing Cloud**: Multi-channel campaign execution and delivery
- **Azure Communication Services**: SMS, email, and notification delivery
- **Alternative Solutions**: Twilio SendGrid, Amazon SES, Braze, Iterable

**Used For**: Both cross-sales and next best actions (executes all customer touchpoints)

---

#### 6. Feedback & Learning System
**Purpose**: Monitor performance and continuously improve recommendation accuracy

**What It Practically Does**:
The Feedback & Learning System operates as the system's "performance coach" that continuously monitors results and optimizes the entire cross-sales engine for better performance. It:

- **Conversion Tracking**: Tracks the complete customer journey from initial recommendation to final policy purchase, measuring conversion rates at each step (email open → portal visit → quote request → purchase)
- **Model Performance Analysis**: Compares predicted customer behavior (propensity scores) against actual customer actions to identify model accuracy and areas for improvement
- **A/B Testing Management**: Continuously runs experiments on different recommendation strategies, messaging approaches, timing, and channels to identify what works best
- **Customer Feedback Integration**: Analyzes customer survey responses, support tickets, and direct feedback about recommendations to understand customer satisfaction and preferences
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies emerging trends like "customers who receive cyber insurance recommendations after industry news events convert 40% better" and updates recommendation logic accordingly
- **System Optimization**: Automatically adjusts recommendation algorithms, timing strategies, and communication preferences based on performance data

**Daily Operations Example**:
- Morning analysis: Compare yesterday's email campaign performance against benchmarks, identify high and low performing messages
- Ongoing monitoring: Track real-time conversion rates from MyBusiness portal recommendations, flag any unusual drops in performance
- Weekly reviews: Analyze which cross-sell products are converting best for different customer segments and adjust recommendation priorities
- Monthly optimization: Update machine learning models with new performance data, retire underperforming recommendation rules, implement successful experimental approaches
- Quarterly insights: Generate business intelligence reports showing ROI of different cross-sales strategies and recommendations for next quarter

**Inputs**:
- Customer responses to recommendations (accepted, declined, ignored)
- Conversion metrics (quote requests, policy purchases, premium amounts)
- Customer satisfaction scores and feedback
- Channel performance data (which methods work best)
- External validation data (industry trends, competitive analysis)

**Outputs**:
- Model performance reports (accuracy rates, conversion improvements)
- Recommendation engine updates and refinements
- Customer preference updates (communication frequency, product interests)
- Business intelligence dashboards (ROI analysis, campaign effectiveness)
- System optimization recommendations (algorithm adjustments, new data sources)

**Existing Systems Integration**:
- **Azure Application Insights**: Performance monitoring and analytics
- **Databricks**: Advanced analytics and machine learning model retraining
- **Salesforce Analytics Cloud**: Business intelligence dashboards and reporting
- **Power BI**: Executive reporting and KPI tracking
- **Alternative Solutions**: Google Analytics 360, Adobe Analytics, Tableau, Looker

**Used For**: Both cross-sales and next best actions (improves entire system performance)

### Component Interactions

**Cross-Sales Flow**:
Data Aggregation → Customer Intelligence → Cross-Sales Engine → Decision Orchestrator → Delivery Engine → Feedback & Learning

**Next Best Action Flow**:
Data Aggregation → Customer Intelligence → Next Best Action Engine → Decision Orchestrator → Delivery Engine → Feedback & Learning

**Integrated Flow**:
Both engines feed into the Decision Orchestrator simultaneously, ensuring customers receive coordinated recommendations that balance product suggestions with optimal engagement timing and approach.

## Detailed Use Cases

To ensure clear implementation guidance and measurable success criteria, here are specific end-to-end use cases that demonstrate the cross-sales solution in action:

### Use Case 1: Growth-Triggered Cross-Sales
**Business Scenario**: IT Services Company Rapid Growth

**Initial State**:
- Customer: Nordic IT Solutions AB (Sweden)
- Current Policy: Professional Indemnity Insurance (€3,000/year)
- Employee Count: 8 people
- Annual Revenue: €2.1M

**Trigger Event**: 
Company files Q3 financial report showing 45% revenue growth (€2.1M → €3.0M) and increases employee count from 8 to 15 people in MyBusiness portal.

**System Response Flow**:
1. **Data Aggregation**: Captures employee update within 15 minutes, flags significant growth signal
2. **Customer Intelligence**: Updates risk profile from "Small IT Services" to "Growing IT Services," increases propensity scores for additional coverage
3. **Cross-Sales Engine**: Identifies gaps - no cyber coverage for IT company handling client data, no D&O for 15+ employee company
